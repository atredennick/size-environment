## Overview

This repository is organized as a project directory, with subdirectories:

  - `code/`
  - `data/`
  - `figures/`
  - `results/`

each of which have their own subdirectories.
The `R` script `./code/MASTER.R` serves as a guide through the analyses necessary to reproduce our results.
Some of the scripts take a while to run, so I suggest interested users consider this more of a way to explore our methods rather than a way to reproduce the work on the fly.
The repository includes the results from running the code (see `results/` and `figures/` directories).
